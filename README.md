# Introduction

My name is Pradhumn Sharma and I have recently started learning Golang. I will add the contents in this repo as per I progress in my learning path. The important thing is that I will not add anything that I learned from video tutorials as it is or same code. But I will extend my knowledge about that particular topic and then will create program according to my understanding and then publish it in this repo.


I am a newbie in this journey so any help or advice or suggestions are highly welcome and appriciated.


Please do checkout my CRUD operations folder in this repo.
