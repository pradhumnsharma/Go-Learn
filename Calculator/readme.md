## Introduction

In this folder, I have implemented a calculator which takes input from user in string format then I convert it into integer and perform various operations.

I have used `Switch` for choosing between various calculation operations. There are two ways by which I have implemented this calculator result.

1. Simple switch case with print
2. Using struct and function to calculate result


### How to use

* Start the application using ### `go run main.go`.
* Follow the instructions

              **OR**

* If on Mac, open the build file present in same folder and follow the instructions


**Note:** I have created a build file also. It is present in the same folder. To create build for other platforms just run `go build .`


### What I Learned
1. How to take user input using buffered I/O
2. How to convert one datatype to another
3. How to use function as value in structures
4. How to use Switch case
5. How to build executable files for MAC and Windows


### `Note:` Please review the work. All suggestions related to improvements are highly welcome and appreciated.
